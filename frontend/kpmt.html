			<h2>History</h2>
			<p>
				The tenth annual KPMT Tournament was held on Saturday, March 17, 2018.
				The test was identical to the 9th KPMT, complete with a Pi recitation contest.
				This was again, the largest KPMT in our history, with over 650 contestants.
				A special thanks to all of the volunteers, National Honors Society, and parents who helped out.
				Cheers to a great 10 years!

				The ninth annual KPMT Tournament was held on Saturday, January 7, 2017.
				The test consisted of a total of six tests: The three team tests were Algebra and Operations, Geometry, and Probability and Potpourri, and the three individual tests were Block Math, Individual, and Mental Math. Once again, we had the PI recitation contest.
				A special thanks to all of the volunteers, National Honors Society, and parents who helped out.

				The eighth annual KPMT Tournament was held Saturday, December 16, 2015.
				The relay round was retired from the contest while a new unique individual test was featured, called the Block Round.
				The Probability/Potpourri round was brought back as well.
				Nearly 450 students signed up, with over a 130 teams participating in the contest.
				It was one of the most successful contests to date, with almost too many volunteers as well!
				The pi recitation contest tradition continued as well.
				We would like to give a special thank you to all volunteers and our math club, as well as the parents and teachers who helped us be able to run such a successful contest.
