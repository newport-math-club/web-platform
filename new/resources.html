			<h2>Practice Tips</h2>
			<p>
				There are three areas that you should aim to improve when you
				practice competition mathematics. They are listed below along with
				some helpful pointers.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Knowledge</b> — Read the entire problem. Think about possible
				approaches to solving it. Then try to solve the problem and check
				your answer. Do another similar problem and try to reinforce the
				concept. If you get stuck, use the internet, a teacher, or a friend
				to help you work through the problem. Memorize any necessary
				formulas or steps. Find a problem-solving method that makes sense to
				you.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Accuracy</b> — Once you understand the related math concept, find
				a series of problems that are similar to the one you learned (or
				make them up if possible). Then, do a short number of problems and
				check your answers. Go over those problems and see what you did
				wrong. Finally, finish the rest of the problems and focus on being
				as accurate as possible. Avoid rushing at this point.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Speed</b> — Now that you are confident that you can solve the
				problem, find or have a friend construct a practice test. Set a
				fast-paced, but reasonable time limit, create an answer grid, and
				go! On scratch paper, write as much as you need to as you work, but
				try not to write so much that it slows you down. Once the time is
				up, review each problem and how you solved it, and search for faster
				methods. Take the test again, and see if you can complete the same
				problems at a faster rate. Over time, you will start to recognize
				similar problems on related tests and you will begin to develop
				faster solution methods.
